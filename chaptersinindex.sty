% Based on so many tutorials and how-tos that I can barely count them all.
% As things did not work as presented with texlive 2015 and koma script,
% I ended up reading the docs and reinventing the wheel, so you will 
% find stancas similar to all the tutorials and how tos...
%
% This now is a merger of mine experiments so far with a modified version
% of 5gon12eder's package from
% http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=17344
%
% Note, that you have to declare all environments you are using,
% for example
%   \AddChaptersToIndex{lof}{figure}
%   \AddChaptersToIndex{lof}{floatingfigure}
%   \AddChaptersToIndex{lot}{table}
%
% Have fun!
%
% Known Problems:
% Sometimes, the chapter is misplaced in the list. The exact issue is 
% unclear, but it seems it can be worked around by moving the figure
% relative to its first reference.
